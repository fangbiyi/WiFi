This is the Machine Learning Toolbox published by Terasoft (http://www.terasoft.com.tw).

Once the toolbox is expanded into a folder, enter that folder and run "mltSetup" to setup the toolbox.

Run "mltDoc" to bring up a list of functions. Run "mltDoc dtw" to show the documentation of "dtw" command, etc.

To get started, run "doc" and click "Machine Learning Toolbox/Getting Started"

For getting more technical details, see the online tutorial at "http://mirlab.org/jang/books/dcpr".
